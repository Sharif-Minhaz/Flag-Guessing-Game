A better maintained and efficient react version is available on https://react-flag-guessing-game.netlify.app/
Raw javascript project require a lot of memory to perform dom operation. Simply we can call it as a resource hungry project. To avoid extra potential and memory we can help a server side rendering solution which works with virtual dom and make dom operation much more easy and super effecient. So, I rebuild this project with react.
